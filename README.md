#NAME OF PROJECT
	Recipe of the Day!

##DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
This application makes a random recipe proposal.  Ingredients and cooking instructions will appear once the recipe is accepted.  Nearby grocery stores will also be shown at the bottom of the application for convenience.

##USER STORY
	As a recipe seeker, 
	I want an application that randomly picks a recipe for me
    so that I can enjoy spending time on making new food rather than trying to find recipe books or websites to find one in my limited free time.

##ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Given I want to cook something delicious and fun
When I load the application
Then I see the image of the proposed recipe 
When I click on the button to accept the proposed recipe
Then I am presented with the ingredients and cooking instructions
When I click on the button to see a different recipe
Then I am presented with the image of a different recipe
When I see the map 
Then I can find grocery stores near my current location 

##OUR MOTIVATION
Food brings us together with our families and friends. Recipes are the secret ingredients that make it happen. But what if we don’t have one?  Our desire to explore fun recipes motivated us to create Recipe of the Day!

##WHAT MAKES OUR PROJECT STAND OUT?
Our application selects all kinds of recipes on a random basis, including international flavors, treats for seasonal events, cocktails, and snacks.  This ransom selection is our unique driver that brings the recipe seekers to a new world of tastes.
